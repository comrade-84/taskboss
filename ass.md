Assignment Overview: Task Management App
Objective: Build a Vue 3 application that allows users to log in, manage tasks (add, complete, delete), view a dashboard with analytics, and see a history of completed tasks with charts. The app will use Pinia for state management, Vue Router for navigation, BootstrapVue 3 for styling, and Options API with lifecycle hooks for component logic.

Learning Goals:

Understand Pinia for state management (tasks and authentication).
Use Vue Router for client-side routing.
Apply Vue lifecycle hooks (e.g., mounted, updated) to handle component initialization and updates.
Implement BootstrapVue 3 components for a responsive UI.
Create charts using a library like Chart.js to visualize task analytics.
Simulate authentication using Pinia to manage user state.
Tech Stack:

Vue 3 (Options API)
Pinia (state management)
Vue Router (navigation)
BootstrapVue 3 and Bootstrap 5 (styling)
Chart.js (for charts, via vue-chartjs)
Localstorage (to persist user state).
Vite (project setup via npm init vue@3)
Features:

Authentication:
Simulated login/logout (no backend, store user state in Pinia).
Login page with username/password fields; redirect to dashboard on success.
Task Management:
Add, complete, and delete tasks.
Store tasks in a Pinia store.
Dashboard:
Display analytics (e.g., total tasks, completed tasks, pending tasks).
Show a chart (e.g., bar chart of tasks by status).
History Page:
List completed tasks with timestamps.
Filter by date range (optional stretch goal).
Routing:
Routes for login, dashboard, tasks, and history pages.
Protect routes to require authentication.
Lifecycle Hooks:
Use hooks like mounted to fetch initial data and updated to log state changes.
